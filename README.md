These are MATLAB code for creating Ulam Spiral (more on: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral).

You will need all the files of this folder.
Just call ulam_spiral(N) and get the co-ordinates of the points upto N*N.

Calling Methods:

(1)

coor = ulam_spiral(N);

will give a 2 row vector output which contains the co-ordinates of the primes in the ulam spiral.
The first row gives all the x co-ordinates and second row gives all the y co-ordinates

(2)

[x,y] = ulam_spiral(N);

x will have the x co-ordinates, and y will have the y co-ordinates.

can be used with MATLAB plot function. The plot is obtained only in the first qudrant.
